# Snake AI with Reinforcement Learning

This project involves training a reinforcement learning agent to play the Snake game. The agent uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn optimal strategies and improve its performance over time.

## Project Structure

- **`game.py`**: Contains the implementation of the Snake game, including the game logic and rendering.
- **`helper.py`**: Includes helper functions, such as plotting results.
- **`model.py`**: Defines the neural network architecture for the Q-Network and the QTrainer class for training.
- **`agent.py`**: Implements the reinforcement learning agent, including methods for training, saving, and loading the model.
- **`arial.ttf`**: A font file used for rendering text in the game.
